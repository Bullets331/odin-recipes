    <li>In a mixing bowl add the breadcrumbs, pour just enough milk to cover, and place aside to let the breadcrumbs soak as 
        you preheat the oven to 350&#8457</li>
    <li> Make the sauce by heating 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan and lightly fry the chopped shallots, pepper, and garlic for 2-3 minutes 
        until soft.</li>
    <li>Add 2 14oz cans of tomatoes, basil, oregano, and some seasoning with a white wine splash to deglaze the pan. Let the sauce simmer for
         about 10-15 minutes</li>
    <li>As the sauce simmers make the meatballs. Place the ground beef and pork into a mixing bowl, add the chopped garlic, parmesan, 1 jalapeno finley 
        chopped with seeds and parsley. <br></lb> Now press the breadcrumbs to take out the excess milk and add them with the ground meat. Thoroughly mix working with hands, then season
        salt and pepper</li>
    <li> Shape balls the size of golf balls, and dust them with flour. Now in a frying pan, heat the olive oil, when the oil is hot start frying 
        the meatballs in batches of 4-5 not to overcrowd them; fry until golden.</li>
    <li>After drying add the meatballs to the sauce and place everything into a casserole dish. Place in a 350&#8457 preheated oven and bake
        for 10 minutes. Serve with your favorite pasta, as a side dish or light salad.</li>
